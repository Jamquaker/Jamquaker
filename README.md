Education has always been central to Dr. Muhanji’s ministry. He recognized that nurturing young minds with Quaker values could lead to profound social change. To this end, he spearheaded the establishment of the Kenyan Quaker High School Principals’ Association.

Challenges and Perseverance

Dr. Muhanji’s journey was not without its challenges. Unifying diverse communities required immense patience, diplomacy, and resilience.
